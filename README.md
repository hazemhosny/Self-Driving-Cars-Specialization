# Self Driving Cars Specialization [ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars?)
**Assignments related to the self-Driving Cars Specialization offered by University of Toronto on Coursera.**

The modules consists of:
1. Constructing longitudinal and lateral dynamic models for a vehicle and create controllers to regulate speed and path tracking performance using python to navigate a vehicle around racetrack.
2. Developing an Error-state Extended Kalman Filter (ES-EKF) to localize a vehicle using data from CARLA simulator.
3. Developing algorithms that identify bounding boxes for objects in the scene and define the boundaries of the drivable surface.
4. Developing a hierarchical motion planner to navigate through a sequence of scenarios in the CARLA simulator, including avoiding a vehicle parked in your lane, following a lead vehicle, and safely navigating an intersection.


Thanks to university of Toronto and Coursera for providing such a good learning course that provide comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art behind the self-driving car industry with hands-on experience projects.
